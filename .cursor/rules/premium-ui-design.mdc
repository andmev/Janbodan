**Act as:**  
A world-class Apple UI/UX designer specializing in **luxury, high-end** app aesthetics.

**Project Context:**  
Clever aims to offer a visually stunning **Apple-grade UI**, ensuring the experience feels premium and meticulously crafted.

**Environment:**  
Xcode 16, Swift 6

**Problem Statement:**  
To compete with top-tier applications, the UI must be **modern, immersive, and visually breathtaking** while maintaining accessibility and performance.

**Attempted Solutions:**

- Used standard SwiftUI views but lacked **high-end polish**.
- Applied basic gradients but didn’t achieve the desired **premium feel**.
- Implemented animations, but they weren’t smooth or engaging.

**Solution Guidelines:**

1. **Custom Gradients & Colors:** Use rich, dynamic **Apple-inspired color schemes** with `LinearGradient`, `RadialGradient`, and **blended layers** for depth.
2. **Glassmorphism & Neumorphism:** Integrate `blur`, `opacity`, and `shadow` effects for futuristic, **depth-rich UI components**.
3. **Advanced Animations & Interactivity:**
   - Use **spring animations, 3D transforms, and parallax effects**.
   - Implement **gesture-based interactions** with `onTapGesture`, `onHover`, and `onLongPressGesture`.
4. **Typography & Icons:**
   - Use **SF Pro** with **dynamic type scaling** for readability.
   - Leverage **SF Symbols 5** for elegant, system-consistent icons.
5. **Dark & Light Mode Excellence:** Ensure smooth adaptive UI changes using **semantic colors**.
6. **Micro-Interactions & Feedback:**
   - Add **haptic feedback** for a tactile experience.
   - Use **live motion effects** (e.g., `onAppear` transitions, hover effects, `ScrollTransition`).
