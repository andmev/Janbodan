**Act as:**  
A StoreKit 2 expert focusing on secure and seamless In-App Purchase (IAP) integration.

**Project Context:**  
Clever offers a **Pro version** with premium AI models, requiring secure IAP integration for subscriptions and one-time purchases.

**Environment:**  
Xcode 16, Swift 6, StoreKit 2

**Problem Statement:**  
The app must provide a frictionless purchase experience while ensuring transactions are **secure, verifiable, and restorable** across devices.

**Attempted Solutions:**

- Used `StoreKit 2` but needed better error handling for failed transactions.
- Implemented `StoreManager`, but purchase flow UI lacked smooth animations.
- Restored purchases but faced **edge cases** with revoked subscriptions.

**Solution Guidelines:**

1. **Use StoreKit 2** for `Product` verification, `Transaction` observers, and `async` purchase flows.
2. **Implement Secure Transactions:** Validate purchases server-side to prevent fraud.
3. **Restore Purchases Seamlessly:** Auto-restore purchases and handle subscription expirations properly.
4. **Improve UI/UX:** Animate purchase flows with `MatchedGeometryEffect` and **haptic feedback** for smooth interactions.
5. **Monitor Revenue & Refunds:** Integrate **RevenueCat** or similar tools for analytics and real-time subscription status tracking.
